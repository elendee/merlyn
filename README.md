merlyn is intended to be an extremely fast, 'hands off' theme for developers to deliver to clients.
It uses the bare minimum of Underscores framework, but cuts out nearly all of the css and js that Underscores ships with.
It implements it's own simple responsive menu and page structure.

To add CSS, using the Appearance > Customizer > Custom CSS is recommended.
